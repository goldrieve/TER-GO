# Trypanosome_evolve_resequence

Multi ‘omic’ datasets will be generated from both laboratory and field strains of T. brucei during this project. All datasets will be deposited on NCBI alongside the TriTryp database, to ensure genome, transcriptome and epigenome datasets are available to the research community. This repository will contain the scripts used to analyse this data.
